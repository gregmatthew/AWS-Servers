172-[JAWS]-Lab - [Challenge] EC2 Instance Exercise
AWS EC2 Instance Challenge Lab
Lab Overview
In this challenge lab, you apply your knowledge of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to create a web application running on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance. You will follow high-level steps to configure a virtual network, launch an EC2 instance, install a web server, and deploy a simple web application.
Objectives
After completing this challenge, you should be able to:

Configure a virtual network.
Place an Amazon Linux EC2 instance into this virtual network.
Install a web server and deploy a simple application on it.

Duration
This challenge requires approximately 45 minutes to complete.
Challenge Instructions
Prerequisites

Start the lab by choosing Start Lab to launch the lab environment.
Wait until the Start Lab panel displays the message "Lab status: ready," then choose X to close the panel.
The lab provides a new AWS account to create the necessary resources for launching an EC2 instance and running a web application.
Next to Start Lab, choose AWS to open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system will automatically sign you in.

Challenge Steps
To complete the challenge, create an Amazon Linux EC2 instance to run a web application by following these steps:

Launch the EC2 Instance

Use the AWS Management Console to launch the instance.
Select an Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
Choose a T3 instance type with a size smaller than medium (e.g., t3.micro).
Launch the instance in a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a new subnet.
Enable auto-assignment of a public IP address for the instance.


Configure User Data

In the user data section during instance creation, include a script to:
Install the httpd service (Apache web server).
Start the httpd service.
Grant write permissions to users for the web server's document root directory (/var/www/html).



Example user data script:
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
chmod -R 775 /var/www/html


Configure Storage

Use a General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume type for the root volume.


Set Up Networking

Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC.
Configure the subnet's route table to include a route to the Internet Gateway for internet access.


Configure Security Group

Create a security group that allows:
SSH (port 22) for secure shell access.
HTTP (port 80) for web traffic.


Associate this security group with the EC2 instance.


Connect to the Instance

Use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to the EC2 instance via SSH in a web browser.


Verify Web Server Installation

Access the EC2 instance's system log and capture a screenshot showing that the httpd service was successfully installed.


Deploy a Web Page

Connect to the EC2 instance using EC2 Instance Connect.
Create a file named index.html in the /var/www/html directory.
Copy and paste the following HTML code into index.html using a text editor (e.g., nano or vi):<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Welcome to My Web Server</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My EC2 Web Server</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my simple web application running on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance!</p>
</body>
</html>


Save the file and ensure it is accessible by the web server.
Use sudo to copy the file to /var/www/html if necessary (e.g., sudo mv index.html /var/www/html/).


Test the Web Server

Access the web page by navigating to the instance's public IPv4 address in a web browser (e.g., http://<public-ip>).
Verify that the web page loads correctly.



Notes

Ensure all resources (VPC, subnet, Internet Gateway, route table, security group) are properly configured before launching the instance.
Use the public IPv4 address to access the web page, not the private IP.
If you encounter permission issues when copying files to /var/www/html, use sudo to elevate privileges.
